# Lux_capstoneProject-
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn in the Telco industry. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling proactive strategies to retain them. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and the formulation of retention strategies based on the model's insights.

Data Collection
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains information on demographics, transaction history, customer service interactions, subscription details, and whether the customer churned.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves:

Handling Missing Values: Missing data is cleaned or imputed as necessary.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables are encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Feature Engineering: New features are created, such as:
Average transaction value

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the data and identify key factors contributing to churn:

Visualization Techniques: Histograms, heatmaps, and boxplots are used to explore relationships between features and churn.

Model Development
Several machine learning models are developed and compared:

Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
Model Selection: Models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Neural Networks are evaluated.
Evaluation Metrics: Models are assessed using accuracy.

Interpretability and Feature Importance
Understanding model predictions is crucial:

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): SHAP values are used to explain individual predictions and overall feature importance.
